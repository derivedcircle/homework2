From Question3, what issues you might obtain during the development of
the program? What issues do you think will happen if some of the actions,
e.g., waking up the ATC, checking the traffic pattern, entering the traffic
pattern, diverging to another airport, etc., take time to finish? And what
will be a potential solution for the issues?

Some of the issues I encountered included very slow thread start ups
where the computer would take very long to allocate tasks to new threads,
resulting in the program running each thread sequentially. I was able 
to isolate the issue to this as with a 50 microsecond delay added in 
the task, the code was able to act more similarly to the presented 
examples of what the code output is intended to look like.

If further delays were added from the ATC needing to wake up, check the 
patern and other airport related tasks, it would likely result in all 
but 3 aircraft being immediatly diverted from the airport. I ran a test 
where I assumed all of these additional delays added up rougly to 1 second 
and was only able to have 3 aircraft land while all others would be diverted.

The best solution to ensuring that the aircraft can land at the airport 
is to set up a proper holding system and queing aircraft down to land 
instead of only granting clearance for one aircraft to land at a time 
similar to how most modern large airports handle arrivals today. This 
would mean that even with standard human delays, the aircraft would be 
able to land and most would not be unnessisarily diverted away.
